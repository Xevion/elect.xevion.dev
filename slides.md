# Goals

What are my goals until Spring 2023?

## Website Revamping

If elected, I can help maintain and improve ACM UTSA's website with design improvements, code cleanup and new features.
ACM's website is built with Jekyll, a static site generator I happen to be quite experienced with.\
Additionally, I've built and shipped several sites with it of varying style and purpose; ACM's can be no different.

## Member Attendance Form

I've found the Member Attendance Form to be lacking in function, speed and overall features. Additionally, the Typeform
it uses to host upon costs ACM hundreds of dollars every year.

If elected, I plan to look into ways to seamlessly replace this specific form in order to reduce costs for ACM,
make attendance marking faster and easier to verify for officers.

# Projects

## Promotion

Projects at ACM are sorely missing - those who wish to promote their projects at all have nearly nowhere to do it,
and this makes feedback, discussion, collaboration and assistance nearly impossible.

Wouldn't you like to show off what you've worked on? Let's make it a new standard at ACM.

## Collaboration

ACM is missing a platform for collaborating on projects together - one is sorely needed to connect those with an idea
to those with the skills. From small projects to grandiose far off ideas, everything is on the table.

---

## Assistance

With my experience and skillset, I believe I can help the members of ACM out with their projects from start to finish.

- **Ideas**: I'm full of ideas when it comes to projects; I can help you expand on your project or provide a viewpoint you hadn't thought of yet!
- **Issues**: With my experience, I've fallen into so many traps, flaws and issues with projects that I guarantee you I can help speculate what problems you'll encounter in development.
- **Tech Stack**: I'm knowledgeable on tech stacks, frameworks and technologies, but even if I don't know what you need yet, I can find out. Let me help you figure out what you need!
